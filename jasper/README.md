## Getting Operating System Image
### Download the image
  [Where to grab the latest image from?](images/README.md)
### Write the image to SD Card
  After downloading the `.zip` file, unzip it to get the image file (`.img`) for writing to your SD card. After that you would need an image writing tool to write that image to your SD Card. Depending upon the OS, please visit the below link to know more about how to do that.
* [Windows](install-image/windows.md)

* [Mac](install-image/mac.md)

## Installing Jasper
Once the .img is written to the SD card, and the OS has booted you will need to complete the [Post-Install Process](jasper-client/Jasper-Post-Image-Setup.md).
